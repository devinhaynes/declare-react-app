# Declare React App
Declarative utility wrapper for create-react-app. Used to build a customized react app template

## Prerequisites
- node
- npx

## Usage
Rename declaration.template.json to declaration.json and add custom parameters such as AppName and Components that you would like to be built on startup

`node main.js`

## Notes
The current version of Declare React App strips away a lot of the incorporated features of create-react-app in order to make a more streamlined, customizable react application. It is intended to add features to allow users to choose the features they would like to keep and those they do not need.
